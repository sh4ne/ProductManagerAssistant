# Product Manager Assistant

This is a project I created for CS 5600 at Utah State University. This application will predict the performance of products from a given data set based on the weather. Using decision trees, the application can determine if a given product would sell well based on  temperature, humidy, wind speed, pressure, and outlook.

The current set of data is local to my machine. If you would like to run this, please follow this schema for your data.
Information(Product ID, Date, Sales, Weather Code, Sell)
